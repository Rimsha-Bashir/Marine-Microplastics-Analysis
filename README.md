# Marine-Microplastics-Analysis 

## Overview 

This project analyzes Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Microplastics in Marine settings by using Machine Learning Algorithms.

## Data Source 

Exported from the [NCEI Marine Microplastic Map Portal](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics)-- A GIS-based map that provides access to aggregated global data on microplastics in marine settings.

## Project Objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

    1.1 To visualize and perform a statistical study of the data, including mean, median, and standard deviation for Microplastic Density and distriution across Oceans and Regions.

    1.2 To find correlation of variables like Microplastic Density measurement, Microplastic Material density range, and coordinates (latitude, longitude).

2. GeoSpatial Analysis : To identify regions and subregions with a higher concentration of microplastic based on the density class, and subregions.

3. Time Series Analysis of Density Distribution :

    3.1 To study trends in density over time, by region or subregions and sampling methods.

    3.2 To develop a time series forecasting model to predict future measurements or density classes.

4. Anomaly Detection : To identify spatial outliers where environmental conditions (e.g., measurements, density) are significantly different from neighboring areas, potentially indicating unusual phenomena or errors in the data.
